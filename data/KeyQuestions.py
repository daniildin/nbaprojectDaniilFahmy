🧠 Key Questions:
Do superteams win more games than balanced teams?
- Are superteams more expensive per win (Cost per Win)?
- Do they generate more revenue per win (Revenue Efficiency)?

- Are superteams “boom or bust”?
(i.e., do they have higher variance in results?)

💡 Why It Matters:
This helps:
- Fans understand if superteams are actually dominant or just hyped.
- Owners/front offices evaluate ROI from assembling superstar rosters.
- Analysts discuss team-building strategies in terms of performance vs cost.

A Superteam in the National Basketball Association (NBA) is an 
arbitrary term to describe a team that uses player acquisitions 
(via trades or free agency) in a short period of time to create a 
higher than average concentration of top-level players. While there 
is no official definition, it is generally viewed as a team with three 
or more Hall of Fame, All-NBA, or perennial All-Star 
players that join together to pursue an NBA championship.

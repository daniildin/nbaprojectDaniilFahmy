Notes:
A Superteam in the National Basketball Association (NBA) is an 
arbitrary term to describe a team that uses player acquisitions 
(via trades or free agency) in a short period of time to create a 
higher than average concentration of top-level players. While there 
is no official definition, it is generally viewed as a team with three 
or more Hall of Fame, All-NBA, or perennial All-Star 
players that join together to pursue an NBA championship.

Criticism:

There has been some controversy about superteams in the NBA. 
Claims persist that superstar players are no longer looking to 
make the game competitive, but rather finding an easier way to win 
championships and nullifying smaller contenders by joining other elites.
From James joining the Heat to Durant joining the Warriors, there has been 
derision from the media and fans in their efforts to unbalance the NBA. 
However, there have been cases for both sides as others argue that the NBA 
has achieved its highest grossing TV revenue, that it was all done under 
the rules of the salary cap, and that it is enjoyable sports entertainment. 
Recent efforts made to punish teams that look to assemble long-term superteams, 
starting in the 2023-24 season, have been implemented under newly established 
salary cap rules and limitations at hand. One such effort/method made was the 
creation of the second tax apron, which looks to significantly hamper teams that 
would look to overspend in order to create their superteams in question.

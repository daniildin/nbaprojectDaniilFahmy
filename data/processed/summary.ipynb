    "# üèÄ Are Superteams Worth It? A Quantitative Analysis of NBA Team Efficiency (2000‚Äì2025)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Authors**: Fahmy Paiziah & Daniil Nasadiuk  \n",
    "**Duration**: Summer 2025  \n",
    "**Affiliation**: Hunter College / Independent Study  \n",
    "**Tools Used**: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Jupyter Notebooks  \n",
    "\n",

    "## üß† Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In the age of superteams‚Äîwhere franchises stack MVP-caliber talent via trades or free agency‚Äîthe NBA has seen dramatic shifts in competitive balance and financial strategy. This project explores a fundamental question:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Are superteams actually worth it‚Äîfinancially and competitively‚Äîcompared to balanced teams?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a dataset of team stats, payroll, revenue, and playoff performance from **2000 to 2025**, we built a comprehensive analysis pipeline to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compare **wins, cost per win, revenue per win**\n",
    "- Label and contrast **superteams** vs **balanced teams**\n",
    "- Examine **volatility**, ROI, and trends over time\n",
    "- Visualize results with rich plots for insight and storytelling\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéØ Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The NBA has evolved from traditional rosters to modern ‚Äúsuperteams‚Äù constructed around All-Star trios (e.g., LeBron‚ÄìWade‚ÄìBosh). These teams often dominate media, attract ticket sales, and influence global fanbases‚Äîbut at what cost?\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to answer:\n",
    "- Do superteams consistently **outperform balanced teams**?\n",
    "- Are they **more cost-efficient or just more expensive**?\n",
    "- Do they offer **higher returns** in terms of revenue per win?\n",
    "- How **risky or volatile** are they?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß± Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Sources\n",
    "- **Advanced team stats** (wins, losses, playoff wins)\n",
    "- **Payroll data** (inflation-adjusted)\n",
    "- **Team revenue data**\n",
    "- Manual labeling of **superteam seasons**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Superteam Definition\n",
    "A team is labeled a ‚Äúsuperteam‚Äù if it satisfies any of the following:\n",
    "- 2 or more **active All-Stars** on the roster\n",
    "- 2+ **max contracts** in the same season\n",
    "- A team popularly regarded as a superteam (e.g., 2017 Warriors)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preprocessing\n",
    "- Cleaned and merged stats by **team + season**\n",
    "- Standardized team names (e.g., ‚ÄúNew Jersey‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúBrooklyn‚Äù)\n",
    "- Converted salaries and revenue to numeric\n",
    "- Created key metrics:\n",
    "  - `cost_per_win = payroll / wins`\n",
    "  - `revenue_per_win = revenue / wins`\n",
    "  - `win_volatility = std(dev) in wins per team over time`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üßÆ Core Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "We focus on **4 key quantitative comparisons** between superteams and balanced teams:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Metric             | Superteams       | Balanced Teams     | Interpretation                             |\n",
    "|--------------------|------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| **Avg Wins**       | 47.8             | 40.2                | Superteams win ~8 more games per season     |\n",
    "| **Cost per Win**   | $2.69M           | $2.50M              | Slightly more expensive, not drastically    |\n",
    "| **Revenue per Win**| $6.14M           | $5.19M              | Higher ROI for superteams                   |\n",
    "| **Win Volatility** | 10.95            | 12.15               | Superteams are more consistent              |\n",
    "\n",
    "These are calculated using groupby-aggregate techniques in Pandas, and validated with t-tests for significance (where applicable).\n",

    "### 1. Violin + Strip Plot ‚Äî Cost per Win\n",
    "Combines distribution curves with individual data points to show:\n",
    "- Median spending for each group\n",
    "- High-spending outliers (some teams spend >$10M per win!)\n",
    "- Balanced teams show more **spread**, while superteams cluster tighter\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Scatter Plot ‚Äî Revenue vs Wins\n",
    "Used to test correlation between **financial performance** and **sport performance**.\n",
    "- Balanced teams cluster at lower revenue\n",
    "- Superteams appear in upper-right quadrants, indicating higher output\n",

    "### 3. Line Plot ‚Äî Cost per Win Over Time\n",
    "Visualizes trends from 2000‚Äì2025:\n",
    "- Both groups show rising costs over time\n",
    "- Superteams appear to **flatten or drop slightly** post-2020 (possible due to CBA & luxury tax adjustments)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Box Plot ‚Äî Cost per Win Spread\n",
    "Shows range and interquartile range (IQR):\n",
    "- Balanced teams have wider IQR\n",
    "- Several outliers with *very high* cost per win appear in both groups\n",

    "We explored the **standard deviation** in wins across seasons for each team, then compared those across superteams and balanced teams:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Balanced teams** have more boom-or-bust profiles\n",
    "- Some overperform (e.g., 2004 Pistons), others collapse\n",

    "## üß™ Limitations & Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Revenue Data Gaps**: Some seasons missing complete team revenue info\n",
    "- **Superteam Labeling**: Subjective to historical perception (manual)\n",
    "- **External Factors**: Injuries, rule changes, COVID-19 seasons not modeled\n",
    "\n",
    "**Future Enhancements**:\n",
    "- Add **playoff wins** and compute **cost per playoff win**\n",
    "- Include **market size** or fanbase metrics\n",
    "- Train a **machine learning model** to predict team efficiency based on roster data\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üßæ Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Superteams dominate headlines‚Äîand based on the data, they **also dominate performance and revenue**. While they cost more per win, the return they generate makes them a **stable, high-yield investment**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Balanced teams, while cheaper, show greater variance. This can lead to surprise playoff runs or total collapses. From a business perspective, **superteams offer better predictability and monetization potential**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, our analysis provides a **data-driven framework** for understanding how financial and strategic decisions translate into on-court results and economic returns in the NBA.\n",
